## Running the Development Environment

To run the development environment using Docker and VS Code:

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Use the **DevContainers** extension to open the project in the development container.
3. Press `CTRL+SHIFT+P` (or `CMD+SHIFT+P` on macOS) and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** from the command palette.
4. Once the container is running, execute the `start.sh` script to initialize the development environment by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Now the devcontainer should be running on `localhost:5173`
